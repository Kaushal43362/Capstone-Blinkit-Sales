Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes Blinkit grocery sales data using SQL for data cleaning and transformations and Power BI for visualization. The interactive dashboards provide actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and outlet distribution.

Project Workflow

Data Cleaning (SQL):

Standardized categorical values (e.g., Item Fat Content).

Aggregated sales, ratings, and item counts across multiple dimensions.

Prepared summary tables for Power BI integration.

Dashboard Creation (Power BI):

Built multiple interactive reports with filters for Outlet Type, Outlet Size, and Item Category.

Visualized KPIs including Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.

Created drilldowns by Fat Content, Item Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Location, and Establishment Year.
